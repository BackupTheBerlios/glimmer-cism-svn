Erosion INSTALL File:
=====================
Brief instruction on how to install this model.

Prerequisites:
==============
You will need to install GLIMMER and all its dependencies.

Compiling under Unix/Linux:
==========================
The erosion model now uses the GNU auto tools. Compiling the sources from a
tarball distribution follows the usual sequence of commands:
./configure
make
make install
to install the model without debugging symbols. There are a number of useful
configure options:
--prefix=path where         the model should get installed
--with-glimmer-prefix=path  where GLIMMER is installed
run ./configure --help for more help

If you install the model from CVS you will need some additional programs such
as python 2.3. The configure script is generated by running ./bootstrap.
Then proceed with the sequence outlined above.
