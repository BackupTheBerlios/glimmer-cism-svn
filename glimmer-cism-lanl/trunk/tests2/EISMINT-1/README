These EISMINT-1 configuration files have been obtained from http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/glimmer-cism/glimmer-cism/glimmer-tests/trunk/ 

Two modification have been made to minimise the file size of the golden standard: 

1. Only output these variables: thk wvel uvel vvel temp 
2. Change the frequency the output data is written from every 1000 years to every 40,000 years.
