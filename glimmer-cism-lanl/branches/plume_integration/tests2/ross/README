Ross Ice Shelf Experiment
=========================
This experiment was designed to model the Ross Ice Shelf off Antarctica.  
For information about the experiment and its results see:
http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/eismint/iceshelf.html

The python scripts provided here (runGlimmer.py and plotResults.py, refered to
in the following as the Ross scripts) were created to run the experiment 
using Glimmer/CISM and compare the results with measured velocities.

PREREQUISITES:
In order to use the Ross scripts, you will need to have Python and one of the
following Python modules installed:
Scientific.IO.NetCDF, netCDF4, or pycdf

To plot the results (which is the usual way to view the output), the Python 
matplotlib library also must be installed.

RUNNING THE EXPERIMENT:
Running the experiment is a two step process.  Each step invokes a python script
by entering a command on the command line.  The working directory should be the
directory which contains the Ross scripts.  This directory should also 
contain three subdirectories, "data", containing input data for the experiment, 
and "output" and "scratch", where the results of running the scripts will be 
written.

STEP 1. Run Glimmer/CISM by invoking the runGlimmer.py script:

python runGlimmer.py

This step runs Glimmer using parameters specified in the ross.config file.

STEP 2. Plot the results by invoking the plotResults.py script:

python plotResults.py

The plots created are saved as ".png" files in the "output" subdirectory of
the directory containing the plotResults.py script.  You can change the type
of file created by changing the value of the variable "plotType" in the
plotResults.py script.  If you prefer to have the plots displayed on the screen
instead of saved to file, set the variable "savePlotInFile" in plotResults.py
to "False" instead of "True".  The variables "savePlotInFile" and "plotType"
are set near the top of the plotResults.py script under the comment line

# Output flags

OUTPUT FILES:
When you run the Ross scripts, they create files in the "output"
subdirectory.  These files are described below.

Files whose names end ".nc" are netCDF files.  The contents of these files can
be examined using a tool such as ncview.
There are three different netCDF files created each time Glimmer is run:
1. raw.nc is netCDF file containing the experiment input data from the "data" 
directory with minimal modification.  This file is really not necessary.
2. ross.nc is an input file created by runGlimmer.py which provides input 
information to Glimmer.
3. ross.out.nc is an output file created by Glimmer.

Files whose names end ".png" are Portable Network Graphics files written by 
plotResults.py containing the plotted data.  This is standard file type that
can be viewed using image viewer software or a web browser.

SCRATCH FILES:
Glimmer creates some additional files in addition to its netCDF output file.
At the end of its execution, runGlimmer.py moves any files in the current
working directory having names ending in either ".txt", ".log", or ".nc" to 
the "scratch" subdirectory under the assumption that they were created by
Glimmer and are not needed.  So... 
WARNING: If you have files with names ending ".txt", ".log", or ".nc" in the
directory from which you are running runGlimmer.py they will get moved
to the "scratch" subdirectory when you run runGlimmer.py
