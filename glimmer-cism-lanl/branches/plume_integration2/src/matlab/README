How to use the matlab scripts in this directory:


To produce a figure comparing the model-computed steady-states against 
quasi-analytic steady-states, do the following.

1.  Kickoff the 12 cases corresponding to acab = {-2.0, 0.0, +2.0} and
    tau_xy_0 = {0 kPa, 10 kPa, 25 kPa, 50 kPa} by running the script

    python <source tree root>/tests/petermann/task_scripts/kickoff_steady.py <unique_str> <queue_mode>

    where <unique_str> is some string like 'sept13.1' and <queue_mode> is 'q'
    to queue up the jobs and 'i' to run them interactively in sequence.

2.  The job output will be written to $GC_JOBS/ssj1_<tau_xy_0>_kPa_<acab>_acab_<unique_str>

3.  Extract the final state for each run by doing:
    a) Create a directory and cd into it
    b) Run:  nc_last_time_slice.py $GC_JOBS/ssj1_*_<unique_str>/*out.nc
    c) scp the directory onto a CIMS machine

4.  Need to generate the quasi-analytical solutions corresponding to the set of runs that were done.
    Edit the script src/matlab/make_exact_sol.m and run it on a CIMS machine.  
    The files will be outputted to the location specified in the variable file_prefix.

5.  The script <src tree root>/src/matlab/shear_exact_solution.py needs to be edited
    to point to the correct model output netcdf files.  Edit the model_prefix and 
    model_suffix variables to point to the correct set of netcdf files.

    Also edit the exact_prefix and exact_suffix to point to the set of .mat files 
    created by make_exact_sol.m.

6. Run shear_exact_solution.m, which generates the desired figure.


To do the 1-dimensional case:

1. Kickoff the 3 cases corresponding to acab = {0, 5, 10} meters/year by running:
   python <project root>/tests/peterman/task_scripts/kickoff_1d_variable_bmlt.py <unique_str> <queue_mode>

2. Job output will be $GC_JOBS/1d_<acab>_bmlt_<unique_str>

3. Similar to point 3 above.

4. Edit the matlab script <project root>/src/matlab/plot_1d_steady_states_model_and_exact to point
   to the nc files containing the model-produced steady-states.  Check the matlab constants.

5. Run plot_1d_steady_states_model_and_exact to produce the figures.


To do the flat shear velocity diagnosis case:
