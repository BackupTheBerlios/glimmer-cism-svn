Notes on how to run this test (e.g. to compare 1st-order and inc.  remapping advection schemes)

 - run the advection.m script in order to generate "advection.mat" file

 - run python script to generate netcdf input from .mat file: "python advection.py advection.config"

 - in fo_upwind_advect.F90, comment out "thck = thck * mask" near the end of the main subroutine

 - in remap_glamutils.F90, comment out "thck = thck + acab*dt" and "thck = thck * wk%mask_ir" from near the end of "horizontal_remap_out"

 - in glam_strs2.F90, comment out all calls to "sparse_easy_solve" (this assumes that which_ho_sparse = 1 in advection.config file)

 - build the code and copy the "simple_glide" executable into this dir

 - choose which advection scheme to test in the advection.config file: "evolution = 3" is incremental remapping, "evolution = 4" is 1st-order upwinding

 - run the code by "./simple_glide advection.config"

 use something like ncview to look at the netcdf output file, "advection.out.nc"
