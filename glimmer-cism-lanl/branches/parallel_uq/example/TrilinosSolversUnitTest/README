This contains a unit test for interfacing with Trilinos solvers. The unit
test includes the following files:
./TrilinosSolversUnitTest.F90
./strat1.xml
../../src/fortran/sparse_type.F90
../../src/fortran/sparse_trilinos.F90
../../src/cpp/call_trilinos.cpp
./Makefile

----------

1. TrilinosSolversUnitTest.F90 is a simple routine, creating a matrix
and a rhs.

2. strat1.xml contains a parameter list for Trilinos linear solvers.

3. sparse_type.F90 defines a simple sparse matrix type.

4. sparse_trilinos.F90 is a simple version of
glimmer_sparse_trilinos.F90, which is a Fortran interface to Trilinos
solvers.

5. call_trilinos.cpp first converts the matrix in triad format to
Epetra_CrsMatrix format, creates Stratimikos and Thyra objects and
performs linear solves.

6. Makefile probably works (with minor modifications) once the auto
conf business is done, and at the moment it is configured for the case
with all the files above being put in the same directory.
