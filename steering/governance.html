    <h1>Glimmer-CISM Governance</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/glimmer-cism/">Glimmer-CISM</a> project aims to provide a dynamic thermo-mechanical ice sheet model that can be
    <ul>
      <li>used as a stand-alone model</li>
      <li>coupled to an Earth system model</li>
      <li>used as a research platform to develop new ice sheet model components</li>
    </ul>
    Glimmer-CISM is an open source project and licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>. Contributors maintain the copyright of their contributions.</p>

    <p>The Glimmer-CISM effort emerged from the open source Glimmer ice sheet model in response to the conclusions of a number of recent workshops stressing the need to address current ice sheet model shortcomings from a common platform. At present, Glimmer-CISM is primarily a joint U.S./U.K. effort with support from DOE, NSF, NASA, and NERC.</p>

    <p>The project is led by the Glimmer-CISM steering committee and managed by the community. That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the steering committee. The job of the steering committee is to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community's job to guide the decisions of the steering committee through active engagement and contribution.</p>

    <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>The following sections outline the various roles for members of the Glimmer-CISM community. Clearly, individuals can fulfil more than one role.</p>

    <h3>The Steering Committee</h3>
    <p>The steering committee is self-appointed and currently consists of the following six members:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="mailto:Magnus.Hagdorn@ed.ac.uk">Magnus Hagdorn</a>, School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh</li>
      <li><a href="mailto:">Jesse Johnson</a>, Department of Computer Science, University of Montana</li>
      <li><a href="mailto:">William Lipscomb</a>, Fluid Dynamics and Solid Mechanics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory</li>
      <li><a href="mailto:">Tony Payne</a>, School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol</li>
      <li><a href="mailto:">Stephen Price</a>, Fluid Dynamics and Solid Mechanics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory</li>
      <li><a href="mailto:">Ian Rutt</a>,School of the Environment & Society, Swansea University</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>The role of the steering committee is to set the strategic objectives of the project and communicate these clearly to the community. Although the steering committee is self-appointed it is answerable to the community.</p> 

    <p>The steering committee together with the maintainers decide on a schedule for stable releases and what they contain. The steering committee approves new maintainers and the addition of feature branches.</p>

    <h3>Maintainers</h3>
    <p>Maintainers are programmers who have made valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both contribute code and screen the contributions of others. Typically, a maintainer will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project lead. The role of maintainer is not an official one, it is simply a position that influential members of the community will find themselves in as the project lead looks to them for guidance and support.</p> 

    <p>Maintainers have no authority over the overall direction of the project. However, they do have authority over their feature branch and can approve contributions to their subsystems. It is a maintainer's job to ensure that the lead is aware of the community's needs and collective objectives, and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project.</p>

    <h3>Contributors</h3>
    <p>Contributors are community members who either have no desire to become maintainers, or have not yet been given the opportunity by the steering committee. They make valuable contributions, such as those outlined in the list below, but generally do not have the authority to make direct changes to the project code. Contributors engage with the project through communication tools, such as the Glimmer-CISM <a href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/glimmer-cism-devel">developer mailing list</a>, and via reports and patches  attached to issues in the <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=10995">bug</a> and <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?group_id=10995">feature</a> trackers.</p>

    <p>Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.</p>

    <p>Some contributors will already be engaging with the project as users, but will also find themselves doing one or more of the following: 
    <ul>
      <li>supporting new users (current users often provide the most effective new user support)</li>
      <li>reporting bugs</li>
      <li>identifying requirements</li>
      <li>supplying graphics and web design</li>
      <li>programming</li>
      <li>assisting with project infrastructure</li>
      <li>writing documentation</li>
      <li>fixing bugs</li>
      <li>adding features</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
    
    <p>As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, they may find that the project lead starts relying on them more and more. When this begins to happen, they gradually adopt the role of maintainer, as described above.</p> 

    <h3>Users</h3>
    <p>Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements. </p>

    <p>Users should be encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users.</p>

    <p>Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become contributors, as described above.</p>

    <p>Any publications based on work performed with the aid of Glimmer-CISM should acknowledge the project by citing the official Glimmer-CISM papers. Currently
    <ul>
      <li>Rutt, I. C., M. Hagdorn, N. R. J. Hulton, and A. J. Payne. 2009. The Glimmer community ice sheet model. <em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em> <b>114</b>: F02004. doi:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1029%2F2008JF001015">10.1029/2008JF001015</a>.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>Support</h2>
    <p>Glimmer-CISM is an open source project so no guarantees are made. Having said that, users can send emails to the <a href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/glimmer-cism-user">user mailing list</a> or use the <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=33164">discussion forum</a>. Bugs can also be reported to the <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=10995">bug tracker</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Decision Making Process</h2>
    <p>The steering committee has the final word when conflicts arise. If the community chooses to question the wisdom of the actions of a maintainer, the project lead can review their decisions by checking the email archives, and either uphold or reverse them.</p>

    <p>The steering committee meets regularly using telephone conferences and communicates using a private mailing list. Any business is discussed during these meetings and the outcome reported to the community via the user mailing list. </p>
    

    <h2>Contribution Process</h2>
    <p>Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are many ways to contribute. For instance, a contributor can be active on the project mailing list and issue tracker, or can supply patches. </p>

    <p>Members of the Glimmer-CISM community will attend various scientific conferences. We anticipate to have a presence at both AGU and EGU meetings. Occasionally workshops and summer schools will be organised. These meetings offer a great opportunity for meeting other community members and discussing future plans.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/glimmer-cism-devel">developer mailing list</a> is the most appropriate place for a contributor to ask for help when making their first contribution. </p>
